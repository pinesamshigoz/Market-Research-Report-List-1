<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retread Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre Cure</li><li>Mold Cure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The retread tyres market is primarily divided into two types: pre-cure and mold cure. Pre-cure retreading involves applying a pre-vulcanized tread to a prepared tyre casing, allowing for quicker production and flexibility in tread design. In contrast, the mold cure process involves molding new tread rubber onto a tyre casing and then vulcanizing it in a single step, resulting in a stronger bond and more uniform tread patterns. Both methods aim to extend the lifespan of tyres while promoting sustainability.</p></p>
